        <ul class="list-example">
            <li>Best is Cats</li>
            <li>Second Best is Dogs</li>
            <li>Third Best is Birds</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-example">Overall, Cats are my favorite pet because they are super cute, require less attention and can still be super affectionate.
            <br> Furthermore, when I was a kid, my family perferred having dogs, which are also lovely, but as an adult I wanted to have a cat.
            <br> Thus, I spent time around different friend's cats, and have decided that in the future, my next pet will be a cat!

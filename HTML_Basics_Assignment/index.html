        <h2>Is HTML Fun to use?</h2>
        <p>As this is my first time using HTML through this course, it can feel quite daunting.<br>However it seems to be really interesting.</p>
        <p>A hobby of mine is assembling computers, and at first I did not know many things but as I continued it was really intriguing.<br> I believe the same thing will happen with HTML, thus I made a list. </p>
